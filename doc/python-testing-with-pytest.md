# Python Testing with pytest (Feb 2022)

Book was written by Brian Okken.

## Preface

### Why pytest?

pytest is a software testing framework, which means pytest is:
- a command-line tool that automatically finds tests you've written
- runs the tests
- reports the results

Also, it can be extended by writing plugins or installing third-party plugins, and integrates well with CI/CD/automation tools.
